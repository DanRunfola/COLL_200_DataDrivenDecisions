\textbf {\large \\ Course Description:} For the increasing volume of information being produced to be useful in decision-making processes, it needs to be systematically organized and analyzed. This course will provide students with an opportunity to apply quantitative methods to a wide variety of real-world problems defined by decision makers from federal and international policy making groups. Course work will include applying a wide set of techniques (such as the analytic hierarchy process, ordered weighting averaging) which integrate human preferences and perception with quantitative information, with an emphasis on uncertainty. Students will learn about and consider the challenges associated with data reduction – how to balance between the limits of human perception, the value of additional information, and temporal constraints imposed by the decision making process.  \\
\\
\textbf {Prerequisite(s):} None.

\textbf {Credit Hours:} 3 \\

\textbf {\large Books and other things you'll need to buy:}\\ 

Books: None, though throughout the course I may assign readings from academic or popular journals – these will be made available through either the Swem library or online via blackboard.\\
Software: You must have a laptop capable of running Microsoft Excel (free versions, such as open office, will not work for this co

\textbf {\large Course Objectives:} 
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep-0.4em
  \item Provide students with a critical understanding of the decision making process and the use of data and intuition on short deadlines.
  \item Develop student’s ability to communicate findings, analysis, and visualization skills for future courses (and jobs).
  \item Expose students to real-world problems that are being engaged with by contemporary problem solvers and decision makers.
  \item Provide an opportunity to earn credit towards the COLL 200 requirement in the Natural World and Quantitative Reasoning domain (passing grade required).

% Course Policies. These are just examples, modify to your liking.
\textbf {\large Time Commitment:} Excelling in college level course work typically requires on average three to four hours per credit per week.  Since this is a four credit course, in addition to the time we meet as a class each week, you should expect to spend nine to twelve hours on average reading, writing, or otherwise preparing for this class on a weekly basis.\\

\textbf {\large Attendance:} This class does not have an attendance policy.  However, it will be difficult to learn enough to pass the class without regular participation, as the majority of course content relevant to tests and assignments will be covered in class.  Unannounced opportunities for extra credit will periodically be given in-class.\\

\textbf {\large Discussions:} Most lecture sessions will begin with a brief discussion of the assigned materials.  As such, each week students will be asked to come to class prepared with two to three bullet points for discussion - these can represent questions the material raised, commentary, or critiques.  These discussion points may be collected for extra credit.\\

\textbf {\large Classroom Behavior:} Please remain civil during discussions to promote the open exchange of ideas and foster a culture of open dialogue.  Please bear in mind that all students are entitled to their own opinion.  You are expected to listen attentively to each person speaking.  Please refrain from eating during class (and, if you must, make sure it isn't loud!).\\

\textbf {\large Teacher-student conferences:} Students performing at a C level or below are required to schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss class performance.\\

\textbf {\large Late / Poor Performance Policy:} Assignments will not be accepted late, excepting in documented circumstances (i.e., an illness with a doctor's note).  \textit{Recognizing that it is entirely possible to underperform on key days, your lowest lab assignment grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.}\\

\textbf {\large Final Project:} The final project will be the culmination of your work in the second half of the semester, and will include both a written report and verbal presentation.  Final presentations will begin the final week of the course, and finish on the day of finals. \\
